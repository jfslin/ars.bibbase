  abstract = {Mobility improvement for patients is one of the primary concerns of physiotherapy rehabilitation. Providing the physiotherapist and the patient with a quantified and objective measure of progress can be beneficial for monitoring the patient's performance. In this paper, two approaches are introduced for quantifying patient performance. Both approaches formulate a distance between patient data and the healthy population as the measure of performance. Distance measures are defined to capture the performance of one repetition of an exercise or multiple repetitions of the same exercise. To capture patient progress across multiple exercises, a quality measure and overall score are defined based on the distance measures and are used to quantify the overall performance for each session. The effectiveness of these measures in detecting patient progress is evaluated on rehabilitation data recorded from patients recovering from knee or hip replacement surgery. The results show that the proposed measures are able to capture the trend of patient improvement over the course of rehabilitation. The trend of improvement is not monotonic and differs between patients.},

  abstract = {Movement primitive segmentation enables long sequences of human movement observation data to be segmented into smaller components, termed movement primitives, to facilitate movement identification, modeling, and learning. It has been applied to exercise monitoring, gesture recognition, human-machine interaction, and robot imitation learning. This paper proposes a segmentation framework to categorize and compare different segmentation algorithms considering segment definitions, data sources, application-specific requirements, algorithm mechanics, and validation techniques. The framework is applied to human motion segmentation methods by grouping them into online, semionline, and offline approaches. Among the online approaches, distance-based methods provide the best performance, while stochastic dynamic models work best in the semionline and offline settings. However, most algorithms to date are tested with small datasets, and algorithm generalization across participants and to movement changes remains largely untested.},

This paper proposes an approach for on-line, automated segmentation and identification of movement segments from continuous time-series data of human movement. The proposed approach uses a two stage identification and recognition process, based on velocity features and stochastic modeling of each motion to be identified. In the first stage, motion segment candidates are identified based on a characteristic sequence of velocity features such as velocity peaks and zero velocity crossings. In the second stage, Hidden Markov models are used to accurately identify segment locations from the identified candidates. The proposed approach is capable of on-line segmentation and identification, enabling interactive feedback in rehabilitation applications. The approach is validated on a 20 person rehabilitation movement dataset.},

Acceleration and gyroscopic data are readily obtainable through small lightweight sensors, and would serve as a more appropriate sensor system for a rehabilitation clinic than a motion capture system.},
