			<h2>Overview</h2>

			The Automated Rehabilitation System (ARS) is a rehabilitation exercise motion supervision system designed to supplement physiotherapists (PTs) with real-time measurement data and automated charting, allowing PTs to focus on patient safety and diagnosis. <br><br>
			
			ARS began as a research project at the University of Waterloo and Cardon Rehabilitation with the goal of creating a rehabilitation system, integrating together sensor data collection, pose estimation, and motion segmentation system with a strong focus in clinical development. Its various components have been verified with rehabilitation data collected from several clinics around Ontario, alongside with feedback from patients and PTs. <br><br>
			
			Today, it is the goal of the Cardon ARS team to build and commercialize this system, to create and support a robust and user-friendly system that PTs and patients can utilize in order to provide PTs with useful tools to strengthen their clinical capabilities.
