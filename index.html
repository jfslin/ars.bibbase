          The Automated Rehabilitation System (ARS) is a rehabilitation exercise motion supervision system designed to supplement physiotherapists (PTs) with real-time measurement data and automated charting, allowing PTs to focus on patient safety and diagnosis. ARS utilizes multiple light-weight body-worn inertial measurement units (IMUs) to perform:
		  
		<ul>
		  <li>goniometry, the estimation of the joint angles of limbs of interest,</li>
		  <li>motion segmentation, the estimation of the starting and ending points of exercise repetitions, </li>
		  <li>provide real-time visual feedback to patients on exercise performance, and</li>
		  <li>automatically document the collected data for PT review for changing patient performance over rehabilitation visits and inspect the data for exercise inconsistencies such as joint compensation. </li>
		</ul>

		In 2010, ARS began as a research project at the University of Waterloo and Cardon Rehabilitation with the goal of creating a rehabilitation system, integrating together sensor data collection, pose estimation, and motion segmentation system with a strong focus in clinical development. Its various components have been verified with rehabilitation data collected from several clinics around Ontario, alongside with feedback from patients and PTs. 

		Today, it is the goal of the Cardon ARS team to build and commercialize this system, to create and support a robust and user-friendly system that PTs and patients can utilize in order to provide PTs with useful tools to strengthen their clinical capabilities.
